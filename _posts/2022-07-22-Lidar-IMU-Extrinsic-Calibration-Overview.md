# 3. Solve AX = XB

The function performs the Hand-Eye calibration using various methods. 

- [ ] One approach consists in estimating the rotation then the translation (separable solutions).

- [ ] Separable solutions solving separately damages the integrity of the kinematics problem and leads to coupling errors in the calculation of rotation and translation.

- [ ] Another approach consists in estimating simultaneously the rotation and the translation (simultaneous solutions).

- [ ] Simultaneous solutions handle rotation and translation simultaneously and describes pose transformation in a unified manner, reducing complexity and improving calibration accuracy.
